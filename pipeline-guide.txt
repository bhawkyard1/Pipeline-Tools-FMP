The pipeline at the top level looks roughly like this:

 ###########################
 ###########################
 ###                     ###        #########
 ### PRODUCTION PIPELINE ### -----> ## UE4 ## -----> THE GAME
 ###                     ###   ^    #########

This bit here is the pipeline tool, and that is what this guide is for.



#############
## RUNNING ##
#############

To run the pipeline tool, double click on:

	run.bat if you are on your laptop
	run-labs-windows.bat if you are in the labs, on windows
	run.sh if you are in the labs and on linux.

A command line should open, and the pipeline tool. Keep the command
line open, it helps you to see what is going on.



##############
## PROJECTS ##
##############

The production pipeline is organised like this:

  PROJECT/
    PRODUCTION/
    APPROVAL/
    IMPLEMENTATION/

To CREATE a new project, type a path in the very top text box. 
This folder should NOT exist yet, the tool will create it for you.
Set your project to this path, by hitting 'Set Active Project'.
Hit 'Create'.
The top part of the tool should light up green.
When the top part is green, the project you are working on exists.

You can now push and pull the project, but not much will happen.
We should make some ASSETS.

## ASSETS ##
############

To create an asset, we have to first give it a name. Once we
have typed in a name, we need to click SET ACTIVE ASSET. If the
asset already exists, the asset panel will turn green, if not,
it will stay red.

Hit CREATE to create an asset. Initially, it will live in the
production folder. All of the files you use to make the asset
should be stored in this folder.

If you are happy with the asset, hit PROMOTE. APPROVAL is where
we will test assets in-game, to see if they are ready.

If an asset can be considered the final version, we can promote it
again to IMPLEMENTATION. At this stage it is game-ready.


#############
## SYNCING ##
#############

The strength of this tool is its online syncing. The workflow
for doing synchronised work with this tool is as follows:

 ->Pull project.
 ->Make changes, add assets etc.
 ->Checkout assets which have been changed.
   ->Only checked out assets will be synchronised.
 ->Push project.
